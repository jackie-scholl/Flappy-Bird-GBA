# Flappy-Bird-GBA
An implementation of [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) on the Gameboy Advance in C++

Right now, this is actually an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. We are learning from
[tonc](http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm), and some of the code is copied or adapted from there, including in particular
the stuff in `source/tonc_demo_lib`.

Not really sure about the license yet.

Be warned; there is no documentation and no tests. Also, as this is for a school project,
**pull requests will not be accepted** (for now).
